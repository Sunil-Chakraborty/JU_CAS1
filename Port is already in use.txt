while trying to run your Django server

Identify the Process Using the Port:
 
sudo lsof -i :8000

Look for the PID (Process ID) associated with it.

sudo kill <PID>
exmp: sudo kill 5583

sudo kill -9 <PID>
The command sudo kill -9 <PID> is used to forcefully 
terminate a process with the specified Process ID (PID).
