Restart the web server: Sometimes, restarting the web server 
can resolve issues with serving static files. You can restart 
the web server using a command like sudo systemctl restart apache2
or sudo systemctl restart nginx, depending on which web server 
software you're using.


Restart the web server:
For Apache:
sudo systemctl restart apache2

For Nginx:
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Apache HTTP Server (Apache):

Apache is one of the most widely used open-source web servers 
globally. It's known for its stability, flexibility, 
and extensive feature set.
Apache supports a wide range of features, including static 
and dynamic content, virtual hosting, SSL/TLS encryption, 
URL rewriting, and more.
It's often used with the mod_wsgi module to serve Python web
applications like Django. Mod_wsgi allows Apache to interface
with Python applications, such as Django, effectively.
Configuration files for Apache are typically located in the
/etc/apache2/ directory on Linux systems.

Nginx:

Nginx is a lightweight, high-performance web server known 
for its efficiency and scalability. It's designed to handle 
a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
While traditionally used as a reverse proxy and load balancer, 
Nginx can also serve static content and proxy requests to 
application servers.
Nginx is often preferred for serving static files and proxying 
requests to backend application servers like Django using the 
uWSGI or Gunicorn application servers.
Configuration files for Nginx are usually located in the 
/etc/nginx/ directory on Linux systems.
