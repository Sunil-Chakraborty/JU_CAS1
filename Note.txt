prepopulate current_dsg with designation in class model
prepopulate addr_perma with addr_corres in class model

pip install django_globals

MIDDLEWARE = (
'django_globals.middleware.Global',
)

Views.py
from django_globals import globals

I would create a "config.py" file on the root directory. and put all global variables inside:

x = 10
my_string = ''
at "view.py":

from your_project import config

def MyClass(reuqest):
    y = config.x + 20
    my_title = config.my_string
...


django-cleanup, it automatically invokes delete method on FileField/ImageField
when you remove model.

pip install django-cleanup


settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = (
     ...
    'django_cleanup.apps.CleanupConfig', # should go after your apps
)
